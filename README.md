# Welcome to our Project!

Our project is an open space where everyone has the opportunity to view the texts and messages we provide. It's a collection of content that we're continually expanding and improving with contributions from the community.

## What can you do?

### Fix errors

We're human, and humans sometimes make mistakes. So, if you find a typo, grammatical error, or simply a strange sentence in your language, don't hesitate to correct it! Every bit of help counts and improves the quality of the content for everyone.

### Add new languages

Languages are gateways to the world. If you're fluent in a language that we don't have yet, we would love for you to help us add it.

## File Naming and Syntax Rules

When contributing, please ensure to follow these conventions:

- The filename should follow this structure: `messages_[LANGUAGE].properties`.
- The syntax within the file should look like this: `test.string=test`.
- No special characters except a period are allowed before the equals sign, like: `te/st.string="test"`.
